## 🧠 About Me

I'm a developer who loves solving real-world problems through automation, clean code, and thoughtful design. With over 5 years of experience, I've built internal platforms, BI dashboards, and scalable apps using tools like:

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Electron.js  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Prisma, PostgreSQL  
- **Tools**: Power BI, Redux, Git, Linux  
- **Other**: Chatbots, WhatsApp Business API, OBS, Zoom SDK

I'm especially interested in building productivity tools for teams, browser extensions, and hybrid apps that connect data across platforms.
